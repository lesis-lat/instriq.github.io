                    A detailed analysis of the attack surface of the product under test, taking into consideration 
                    the security expectations, objectives and threat model.
                    In general, our approach of vulnerability research aims to verify the resilience of all components of the product
                    under test - typically, this service is composed of architecture review, supporting infrastructure testing,
                    application security, code review and reverse engineering, as well as the creation of bespoke tools such as 
                    fuzzers and custom code static analyzers.

                    Hard problems require unique solutions. We create tailor made tools for optimizing operation,
                    providing exclusive capabilities and tailored on-demand research to improve exploitation and post-exploitation tasks.
                    From high level design to low-level implementation.
                    In the past years our team are worked on projects around topics like: static analysis, fuzzing, data mining and other.

        <h3 class="ibm-plex-sans-light">
            <p>
                At LESIS (Laboratory of Engineering Studies in Information Security), our focus is on applied research in offensive security technologies that underpin critical operations. Our team of engineers and researchers is dedicated to uncovering vulnerabilities, developing innovative solutions, and strengthening the security of organizations facing complex cybersecurity challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a deep understanding of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by attackers, we offer a unique perspective on protecting systems and infrastructures. We work closely with our collaborators, tailoring strategies to meet specific needs and objectives. Whether through vulnerability research, advanced exploitation techniques, or the development of custom tools for security assessments, our aim is to reinforce digital resilience and empower those involved to stay ahead of emerging threats.
            </p>
          <p>
            Our commitment is to deliver world-class research, cutting-edge technology, and actionable insights that contribute to a safer digital landscape. At LESIS, we do more than assess security—we propel it forward.    
          </p>
